This is one of my first personal projects I've been working on. It is so old
that looking at the code gives me creeps :D. Back in the day (when I was
building a hacker personality :)) I was amazed by networking, so I wrote netdt
- a LAN scanner that uses ARP protocol to find which hosts are up. Code
compiles only on Linux and you will need root privileges to run it.
